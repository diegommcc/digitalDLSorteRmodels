\description{
\code{DigitalDLSorter} DNN model stored as a list built and
trained with single-cell data from Li et al., 2017 (GSE81861). This model
allows the enumeration and quantification of immune infiltrated cell types in
colorectal cancer environment. This data set consists of single-cell RNA-seq
profiles from 11 patients from different tumor etiology and stages (see
Torroja and Sanchez-Cabo, 2019 and Li et al., 2017 for more details). The
analysis and characterization of cells was carried out by the authors of
\pkg{digitalDLSorteR}.
}
\details{
This model considers 10 cell types: cancer cells (CRC), epithelial (Ep),
monocytes (M), macrophages (Mc), fibroblast (Fb), CD4 T cells (CD4), CD8 T
cells (CD8Gp), CD8 T cells (CD8Gn), germinal center B cells (gB) and mature B
cells (pB).

The genes considered are 36477 in SYMBOL notation.

The model consists of 2 hidden layers with 200 neurons per layer trained with
'kullback_leibler_divergence' loss function, batch size equal to 128 and a
number of epochs equal to 30.
