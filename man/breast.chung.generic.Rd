\description{
\code{DigitalDLSorter} DNN model stored as a list built and trained with
single-cell data from Chung et al., 2017 (GSE75688). This model allows the
enumeration and quantification of immune infiltrated cell types in breast
cancer environment. This data set consists of single-cell RNA-seq profiles
from 11 patients from different tumor etiology and stages (see Torroja and
Sanchez-Cabo, 2019 and Chung et al., 2017 for more details). The analysis and
characterization of the cells was carried out by the authors of
\pkg{digitalDLSorteR} package.
}
\details{
This model considers 7 cell types. They are generic groups of the cell types
considered by the specific version: B cells, T CD4+ cells, T CD8+ cells,
monocytes, dendritic cells, stromal cells and tumor cells.

The genes considered are 23260 in SYMBOL notation.

The model consists of 2 hidden layers with 200 neurons per layer trained with
'kullback_leibler_divergence' loss function  batch size equal to 128 and a
number of epochs equal to 25.
